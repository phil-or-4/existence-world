# existence-world
This is another project I did to test my abilities with building data structures to suit my needs.
The goal was to have a 20x20 Grid. Each block of that grid is called a sector. In each sector and can have as many people
as I want. People each have id's, and every person as a unique id. If a person dies, their id can be used by and next 
new born person. Each person can do three thing, move, be born, or die (hence the name "existence-world" since each
person just exists they don't do anything else). 

So the main thing is getting everything to work, the next goal is to make all the operations runtime constant O(1). The functions are as follows.
